# 3DGraphicsGame
 ###  Creating a game / game engine using OpenGL (3.3) and SDL 2  
### I'm creating this project to better learn Graphics Progamming (OpenGL) and also improve in Game Development.  
----------------------------------------------------------------
### This project is coded with C++, using SDL 2 for input, audio, game menu rendering, and window creation with OpenGL being used for the actual game graphics.

# The Rough Idea

 ## SDL 2 will be used to render Game Menu's (options, launch, etc) (I've created the Menu Manager and launcher)
 ## SDL 2 will get input from user (I've created a keyboard manager to keep track of input)
  
 ## OpenGL will be used for Graphics.
    Currently have 3D capabalitiy. Camera view is controlled with WASD / arrow keys(forward,left,etc.) and Keypad for rotation. Space Bar and left Ctrl (Up and down)
